# Research-Project
This research study, published in the Indian Journal of Pharmacy Practice (IJOPP), demonstrates that outpatient gastrointestinal endoscopy can be effectively performed without sedation. This approach minimizes common sedative-related side effects, reduces costs, and enhances patients' quality of life.
# Impact of Non-sedation in Gastrointestinal Conventional Endoscopy Practices in Outpatient Setup

## Description

This study evaluates the impact of non-sedation in gastrointestinal conventional endoscopy practices in an outpatient setup. The importance of this study lies in assessing the safety and tolerability of non-sedation methodology and suggesting the benefits of non-sedation procedures.

## Background

Non-sedated endoscopy has a significant role in GI endoscopy practice. It is technically available to a limited number of patients, and smaller diameter endoscopes can improve tolerability when no sedation is used. Non-sedated endoscopy is common in several European countries and has shown to have minimal risk of complications while improving procedural efficiency.

## Aim

To evaluate and study the impact of non-sedation in gastrointestinal conventional endoscopy practices in an outpatient setup.
- Assessing the necessity and indications for non-sedation in selected patients.
- Evaluating pre and post-procedure pain scores.
- Analyzing post-endoscopy complications.
- Assessing safety measures and the quality of life of post-endoscopic patients.

## Materials and Methods

### Study Design

A prospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Gastroenterology at Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) Hospital. The study included 150 patients over six months.

### Inclusion Criteria

- Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Patients with a history of Dysphagia, Odynophagia of either sex.

### Exclusion Criteria

- Subjects under 18 years old
- Patients with cardiorespiratory problems, recent myocardial infarction
- Pregnant and lactating women

### Data Collection

Data was collected from patient records, including case sheets, lab reports, and medical history. Tools and software were used to analyze the collected data.

### Statistical Analysis

All data were compiled in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using statistical methods.

## Results

- **Demographic**
  - Total Subjects: 150 (88 males, 62 females)
  - Age Groups: 18-21 years (4), 22-35 years (25), 36-49 years (39), 50-65 years (40), over 66 
    years (48). 
- **Cheif Complaints**:
  - Dysphagia (17%),
  - Dyspepsia (31%),
  - Acidity (6%),
  - Reflux (7%),and
  - Other conditions including malaena, acid peptic ulcer, hiccups, esophageal varices, 
    stomach pain, burning sensation, mesenteric vein thrombosis, ALD-CLD Portal Hypertension, 
    abdominal distension, and CLD s/p EVL.
- **Post Endoscopy Complications**:
  - Difficulty in swallowing (47%),
  - Throat pain (31%),
  - Vomiting sensation (21%), and
  - Change in speech (1%).
- **Pain Scores**:
  - Pre-endoscopy: Little discomfort (57%), mild pain (35%), moderate pain (9%), severe pain 
    (0%),
  - During endoscopy: Pain observed in 59% of subjects,
  - Post-endoscopy: Pain decreased progressively from 58% after 2 hours to 13% after 6 hours.
- **Oxygen Saturation Levels**:
  -  100% SpO2: 36 cases,
  -  98% SpO2: 59 cases,
  -  97% SpO2: 55 cases.
## Discussion

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is a common procedure for diagnosing and treating problems in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Non-sedation endoscopy has shown to be safe, cost-effective, and well-tolerated by most patients. The study's findings support the use of non-sedation endoscopy to avoid the side effects and additional costs associated with sedatives.

## Conclusion
The study concludes that patients can undergo endoscopy procedures without sedatives, reducing unwanted side effects and improving quality of life. Non-sedated endoscopy is a viable option, decreasing the need for patient monitoring post-procedure.
